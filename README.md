# Online Customer Spending Habits Analysis
# Situation
Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, aims to introduce a new line of credit cards to expand its financial market reach. AtliQ Data Services, having learned about this initiative through an internal link, proposed to implement a project to analyze customer spending habits. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover, expressed skepticism and requested a pilot project using a sample dataset. This dataset comprises information on the online spending habits of 4,000 customers across five cities, which will be analyzed to demonstrate the potential effectiveness and insights of the proposed full-scale project.I collected this data from codebasics.io website where the challenge was conducted.
# Task
As a data and business analyst for this project, my primary task is to analyze the sample dataset provided by Mitron Bank, consisting of online spending habits of 4,000 customers across five cities. I will create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes key spending patterns and trends, identify customer segments, and provide actionable insights. This will involve data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using  Excel. The goal is to deliver a compelling pilot project that addresses Mr. Bashnir Rover's concerns and demonstrates the value AtliQ Data Services can bring in informing Mitron Bank’s strategy for their new line of credit cards.
# Action
In this project, my actions as a data and business analyst involved leveraging Excel to its fullest potential. I utilized the INDEX MATCH function to accurately draw and consolidate data across multiple tables, ensuring seamless data integration. This was followed by thorough data cleaning to remove inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for analysis. I then employed pivot tables to dynamically summarize and analyze the data, creating interactive and insightful visualizations. These steps enabled me to build a detailed and informative dashboard that highlights key spending habits and patterns among the 4,000 customers, providing actionable insights for Mitron Bank’s credit card strategy.The Preview of the Dashboard is available below.
