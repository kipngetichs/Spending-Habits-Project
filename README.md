# Card Utilization Insights
# Situation
Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, aims to introduce a new line of credit cards to expand its financial market reach. AtliQ Data Services, having learned about this initiative through an internal link, proposed to implement a project to analyze customer spending habits. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover, expressed skepticism and requested a pilot project using a sample dataset. This dataset comprises information on the online spending habits of 4,000 customers across five cities between Months of May and October which will be analyzed to demonstrate the potential effectiveness and insights of the proposed full-scale project.I collected this data from codebasics.io website where the challenge was conducted.
# Task
As a data and business analyst for this project, my primary task is to analyze the sample dataset provided by Mitron Bank, consisting of online spending habits of 4,000 customers across five cities. I will create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes key spending patterns and trends, identify customer segments, and provide actionable insights. This will involve data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using  Excel. The goal is to deliver a compelling pilot project that addresses Mr. Bashnir Rover's concerns and demonstrates the value AtliQ Data Services can bring in informing Mitron Bank’s strategy for their new line of credit cards.
# Action
In this project, my actions as a data and business analyst involved leveraging Excel to its fullest potential. I utilized the INDEX MATCH function to accurately draw and consolidate data across multiple tables, ensuring seamless data integration. This was followed by thorough data cleaning to remove inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for analysis. I then employed pivot tables to dynamically summarize and analyze the data, creating interactive and insightful visualizations. These steps enabled me to build a detailed and informative dashboard that highlights key spending habits and patterns among the 4,000 customers, providing actionable insights for Mitron Bank’s credit card strategy.The Preview of the Dashboard is available below.

# Recommendations
Based on the results of the project, the following recommendations are made to Mitron Bank:
- Focus on Peak Spending Periods: With customer spending peaking in September, marketing efforts and promotional campaigns should be intensified during this period to maximize credit card usage and customer engagement.
- Target High-Spending Age Groups: Given that the 35-45 and 25-34 age categories spend the most, tailor credit card products and marketing strategies to appeal specifically to these demographics. Personalized offers and benefits can attract and retain these high-value customers.
- Gender-Specific Campaigns: Since 53% of the spenders are male, consider creating targeted campaigns that cater to male customers' spending preferences while also identifying strategies to engage more female customers.
- Promote Popular Spending Categories: Focus promotional efforts on bills, groceries, electronics, and health & wellness, as these are the categories where customers spend the most. Offering cashback or reward points in these areas can drive higher credit card usage.
- City-Specific Strategies: Concentrate marketing and customer acquisition strategies in Mumbai, Delhi NCR, and Bengaluru, where customer spending is highest. Tailored city-specific promotions and partnerships can enhance customer loyalty and spending.
- Occupation-Based Targeting: Since salaried IT employees, freelancers, and other salaried employees are the highest spenders, design credit card products with features and benefits that cater to their financial needs and lifestyle. Special offers for these occupations can boost spending and card adoption.
- Optimize Payment Methods: With 40% of customers using credit cards and significant usage of UPI and debit cards, ensure that the new line of credit cards offers seamless integration with these payment methods. Consider introducing incentives for credit card usage to shift more transactions from UPI and debit cards to credit cards.
